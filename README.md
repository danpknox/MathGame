The function of this project is a math game that helps develop basic skills such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The code incorporates conditionals and the random function. Upon running the program, the user is asked to choose the skill they want to practice, then presented with ten problems related to that skill. Solutions to any incorrectly-answered problems are provided, as well as the total score of correct answers given at the end. I created this project as a junior in high school and presented it at a school wide expo.
